In this respect, UniProt/Swiss-Prot is currently the most comprehensive collection and it is routinely cross-examined when trying to unravel the biological role of hypothetical proteins. Bioscientists frequently extract single entries and further evaluate those on a subjective basis. In lieu of a standardized procedure for scoring the existing knowledge regarding individual proteins, we here report about a computer-assisted method, which we applied to score the present knowledge about any given Swiss-Prot entry. Applying this quantitative score allows the comparison of proteins with respect to their sequence yet highlights the comprehension of functional data. <italic>pfs</italic> analysis may be also applied for quality control of individual entries or for database management in order to rank entry listings.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Life scientists seek to accumulate knowledge about the
distinct functions of biomolecules. Currently, approximately 20000 gene loci
with a total of up to 35000 transcripts have been reported for the human genome
and transcriptome, respectively [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Genomics and proteomics also greatly support efforts of
systems biology, which may certainly provide a better understanding of complex
biological processes at the organismic level. The prerequisite for this endeavour
is to gain as much knowledge as possible about any functional feature in
respect to any particular gene product. Therefore, many disciplines in life
sciences use protein sequence data for comparative studies in order to assess
distinct functional properties in the context of particular biological
situations. Beside printed publications, most data acquired have been collected
and assembled into a variety of publicly available databases [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. These are generally accepted to represent a common source of
knowledge for research related to biochemistry, molecular biology, biomedicine,
or systems biology. In addition, to simply archiving data, interdisciplinary
efforts are currently being undertaken to fully annotate genomic and proteomic
sequence data sets [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The overall goal in this context is to increase the 
general
and detailed understanding about genomes and proteomes.</p><p>UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot and UniProtKB/TrEMBL store protein
primary data and associated biological and biochemical information. These two
are often used as the prime source for data mining. In this study, we focused
on the knowledge regarding functional aspects of proteins archived in
Swiss-Prot because this repository is generally believed to be a high-quality,
manually curated protein knowledge base [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Moreover, relevant information is primarily extracted from
original publications and review articles, and qualified feedback from external
experts is also taken into consideration by the curators of Swiss-Prot. By
implementing standardized operational procedures, they build up and edit
individual entries [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Briefly, Swiss-Prot entries contain information concerning literature references,
functional descriptions, domain structure, isoforms, and many more selected
information regarding the respective protein [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Most entries provide a summary of functional aspects as
well as other details, such as posttranslational modifications within their 
<italic>COMMENTS</italic> field. Firm data such as those derived from biochemical analyses are assigned
clear-cut attributes. For instance, the various properties of an enzyme are
recorded by a <italic>CATALYTIC ACTIVITY</italic> as
well as by a <italic>FUNCTION</italic> attribute. Yet,
in cases other than enzymes, any other biological function can also be found
within the <italic>FUNCTION</italic> attribute. 
Biologically, relevant information is also reflected in the protein name (<italic>DESCRIPTION</italic> line). Other categories such as 
<italic>ENZYME
REGULATION, PATHWAY, and TISSUE</italic> provide only little further information
concerning the protein functional properties than already defined by <italic>FUNCTION OR CATALYTIC ACTIVITY.</italic>
</p><p>When using computer-assisted methods, the primary structure
of proteins can be easily searched for likely regions of resemblance. Annotated
knowledge can be adopted by applying automated bioinformatic routines for those
sequences, which are not explicitly listed in Swiss-Prot, but however, share
remarkable similarity with experimentally well-studied proteins or protein
sequence motifs that have previously been characterized in detail [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. It has now become generally accepted that information
available for proteins from closely-related species can be linked to the human
proteome. However, complex information regarding experimental data still has to
be manually extracted from published literature or databases. In order to
enhance this tedious procedure, we here report a novel method, which weighs the
quality of an entry with respect to proposed functional properties of proteins. 
In order to accomplish that, all textual descriptions within Swiss-Prot were
scanned for expressions that specify whether experimental analysis regarding
the proteins' biological function is yet in progress or whether published
results are still insufficient in order to accurately deduce the protein's role
with respect to any particular biological mechanism, pathway, or process. The
output of our computer-assisted examination resulted in a score for every
database entry, which grades the currently existing knowledge and was,
therefore, termed the &#x0201c;protein's function score&#x0201d; (<italic>pfs</italic>).</p><p>In parallel to the development
of the <italic>pfs</italic> procedure, we performed a
peer survey. A representative group of trained biologists was asked to manually
assess the functional knowledge for 30 randomly selected Swiss-Prot entries. The
outcome and feedback guided us when specifically moulding the computer-assisted
procedure for the evaluation of currently available information concerning the individual
functional properties of proteins. The resulting computational measure was subsequently used for benchmarking of the current knowledge regarding entries in data repositories and
libraries. This relation allowed us to incorporate <italic>pfs</italic> into the result list of protein-protein sequence comparisons. This particular feature
provides a reliable indication of how well a particular query hit has been
previously annotated regarding functional assignments. Precomputed protein's function scores (<italic>pfs</italic>) and online BLASTP searches against <italic>pfs</italic>-annotated Swiss-Prot database are accessible at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://biwww.che.sbg.ac.at/PFS/">http://biwww.che.sbg.ac.at/PFS/</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2. Methods</title><sec sec-type="subsection" id="subsec2.1"><title>2.1. Peer Survey</title><p>Database entries were randomly selected. 13 peers comprising of one
undergraduate student who has been trained in molecular biology, five PhD
students, five post doctoral fellows, and three principal investigators working
as scientists in the field were asked to validate the information provided with
these particular entries and to regard the displayed existing knowledge about
the protein as high, medium, or low.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subsection" id="subsec2.2"><title>2.2. Computing Knowledge Factor-quantitative Evaluation
of Database Entries</title><p>A simple rule was generated in
order to yield a solid estimate for the information content of Swiss-Prot: for
every single entry, a score was compiled named <italic>pfs</italic>, which is the sum of factors computed for the respective
sections of a Swiss-Prot entry, where LITERATURE REFERENCES is denoted <italic>f</italic>
<sub>1</sub>,
DESCRIPTION = <italic>f</italic>
<sub><italic>d</italic></sub>, FUNCTION,
and CATALYTIC ACTIVITY = <italic>f</italic>
<sub><italic>f</italic></sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). At the beginning of the
evaluation procedure, value &#x0201c;1&#x0201d; was assigned to <italic>f</italic>
<sub>1</sub>, <italic>f</italic>
<sub><italic>d</italic></sub>, and 
<italic>f</italic>
<sub><italic>f</italic></sub>
as long as the corresponding section displayed any
content. Before summing up all increments, which would yield highest possible
value <italic>of 3</italic> for 
<italic>pfs</italic>, all fields were
searched for words or phrases of devaluating meanings, which in due course
result in the decrease of the relevant factors, 
<italic>f</italic>
<sub>1</sub>, <italic>f</italic>
<sub><italic>d</italic></sub>, and <italic>f</italic>
<sub><italic>f</italic></sub>. Terms were selected, which reflect the deliberation
of authors to express uncertainty (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>). Several of the terms with a
specified meaning have been defined by Swiss-Prot [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. For example, the <italic>DESCRIPTION</italic> or <italic>FUNCTION</italic> fields may contain terms which underline the
complete or near inability to assign biological function, such as
&#x0201c;unknown,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;not known,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;unnamed,&#x0201d;
&#x0201c;hypothetical,&#x0201d;
and &#x0201c;uncharacterized.&#x0201d; In cases where the <italic>DESCRIPTION</italic> field contains the term &#x0201c;putative,&#x0201d; 
<italic>f</italic>
<sub><italic>d</italic></sub>
is decreased to 0.5. If the <italic>DESCRIPTION</italic> includes
&#x0201c;unnamed,&#x0201d; this would result in a zero contribution to <italic>pfs</italic>. In
addition to this, a factor was assigned less weight when the entry was
qualified as to be deposited &#x0201c;by similarity.&#x0201d; During the
computational evaluation, each field was split into single sentences and each
sentence was searched for devaluation phrases. When analyzing a sentence, the
phrase list was searched from top to bottom. The first match determined the
reduction of the respective factor <italic>f</italic>. 
Validation of literature references was processed as follows: firstly, every
single literature reference was evaluated with respect to the same criteria as
described for <italic>f</italic>
<sub><italic>d</italic></sub> and <italic>f</italic>
<sub><italic>f</italic></sub>, that is, every single
literature reference was searched for keywords, and subsequently, the average
raw literature factor was calculated. Exceptionally, Swiss-Prot entries may be
the result of automated submissions of genome or expressed sequence tags (ESTs) sequencing
data. The accompanying publications rarely address functional questions nor do
they experimentally verify bioinformatic analyses via firm biochemical
investigations prior to submission to Swiss-Prot. Therefore, Swiss-Prot added a
special attribute for large scale experiments, such as genome sequencing or
functional genomic approaches. These publication formats were rated zero. 
Apparently, a large number of publications is often a good reflection of accumulating knowledge. However, 
<italic>f</italic>
<sub>1</sub> (<italic>pfs</italic> increment for literature) should not overwhelm the value of
functionally-related terms as defined before. As a matter of fact, entries for
proteins with largely unknown molecular function typically have <italic>f</italic>
<sub><italic>d</italic></sub> and 
<italic>f</italic>
<sub><italic>f</italic></sub>
values that are low or close to zero. In cases of
entries that contain numerous publications, the mere addition of an average raw
literature factor to the aforementioned low <italic>f</italic>
<sub><italic>d</italic></sub>
and <italic>f</italic>
<sub><italic>f</italic></sub> would yield a
deceptively high <italic>pfs</italic> value. Therefore,
the average raw literature factor was compared to the assessment calculated
from the sections <italic>DESCRIPTION</italic>, <italic>FUNCTION</italic>, and 
<italic>CATALYTIC ACTIVITY</italic>, respectively. 
The average literature factor was factorized by
multiplication with the maximum of <italic>f</italic>
<sub><italic>d</italic></sub> and <italic>f</italic>
<sub><italic>f</italic></sub>. The
proposed scheme has been built and refined iteratively by reading the content
of several hundred Swiss-Prot entries and checking the coherence with the
calculated <italic>pfs</italic>. The source code for
computing pfs for Swiss-Prot is available upon request.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>3. Results</title><sec sec-type="subsection" id="subsec3.1"><title>3.1. Evaluation of Database Entries by Peers</title><p>Scientists, who routinely use
Swiss-Prot or have been trained to extract information about protein from a
variety of data repositories, were asked to evaluate 30 randomly picked
Swiss-Prot entries. Eventually, the quality of all data as provided within the
Swiss-Prot entry for this particular protein should be regarded as being high,
medium, or low (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab2">Table 2</xref>). In cases, where the biological role or the functional
property of the respective proteins is properly described by published data,
the cumulative knowledge about this protein was considered high. In cases,
where there is still experimental data necessary to clarify the biological
function of the protein or the data are purely descriptive, the information
content presented in such entries was ranked medium or low. No further sources
of information than those provided by Swiss-Prot had been allowed for this
particular evaluation. In a few cases, there appeared only little concordance
between peer evaluation results (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab2">Table 2</xref>, column &#x0201c;maj&#x0201d;). As a lowest degree
of consistence, 38% was
obtained regarding database entries P01827 and Q9N2B6, respectively. Total
agreement was achieved again in two cases, Q57910 and P05484. Random scoring would have resulted in 30%
of the entries gaining the lowest possible concordance score (39%) and 90% achieving
&#x0003c;62% of consensus, which is in strong contrast what was attained by the
peer group. The lowest possible as well as the highest concordance score were much
lower, 7% and 50% respectively. Apparently, there seems to be a bias due to
personal appreciation in respect to knowledge archived in biological databases. 
For instance, PI3 assigned grade &#x0201c;high&#x0201d; to two thirds of the entries, while Ph2
accounted the same number of entries as containing little knowledge. Additionally,
the peers also had to report one field for every particular database entry,
which had the highest impact on her/his individual decision. In 35% of the
decisions, the COMMENT-FUNCTION line was considered most important, in 16%,
it was the protein's name as provided in the DESCRIPTION line, and in 13%, the
reference list was most appealing for the evaluating peers. Lines such as
COMMENTS, FEATURES, COMMENTS-CATALYTIC ACTIVITY, CROSS REFERENCES, or KEYWORDS were chosen only in
below 10% of the cases of the individual decision making processes. Most
interesting in this context, peers rarely pointed out that the decision was
decisively influenced by literature citations that are embedded in most
Swiss-Prot entries. We would furthermore like to note that peers, who applied
subjective decision making criteria when validating the currently archived
knowledge about a protein's function, did not raise any objections to grade individual
entries according to set quality ratings such as low, medium, or high. This
strongly suggested to us that any quantitative measure resulting from a
standardized procedure, with particular attention paying to biological function
information as contained in individual database entries would be also appreciated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subsection" id="subsec3.2"><title>3.2. Computational Evaluation of Database Entries</title><p>Quality assessment of all
Swiss-Prot entries was done by putting weight on to what is currently known
about the biological function(s) of an individual protein. The information is abstracted
in the respective sections of a Swiss-Prot entry <italic>LITERATURE REFERENCES</italic>,
<italic>DESCRIPTION</italic> and <italic>FUNCTION</italic>, and 
<italic>CATALYTIC ACTIVITY</italic>. These
fields were also highly appreciated by the peers for measuring biological
function. Therefore, the text included in these sections was carefully evaluated
for particular specifications of down-weighing characterizations as shown in
<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>. Next, the above-mentioned database fields of every single Swiss-Prot
entry were examined, and the respective information content was weighed in
order to recount and score the currently existing knowledge with regard to the
protein's functional properties. As described in the methods section, summing
the resulting scores that had been calculated from the database lines equals <italic>pfs</italic> with a maximum value of 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The evaluation scheme acts on the assumption that any field contains
standardized textual information. In order to ensure that, the procedure relies
not only on parsing of the quantity of text contained in every field, we determined
whether there is any correlation between word counts of the individual fields reference
title, COMMENTS or DESCRIPTION, and <italic>pfs</italic>. 
When plotting log (number of words) against <italic>pfs</italic>,
only a weak correlation of <italic>r</italic> = 0.66 after applying Pearson's formula could be
observed (when omitting log scaling, correlation decreases to <italic>r</italic> = 0.42). In
addition to this, we observed a rather broad distribution with respect to word
count, which makes it hard to believe that <italic>pfs</italic> may be deduced by merely counting words. We furthermore analyzed the degree of
consent between peers scoring and <italic>pfs</italic>. 
Taking the entire data set into account, only a week correlation of <italic>r</italic> = 0.58
could be revealed. When selecting only those cases that resulted in a
concordance score of &#x0003e;62%, which was half of the entries, a correlation of <italic>r</italic> = 0.78 was obtained.</p><p>As a next step, <italic>pfs</italic> was used to classify all Swiss-Prot
entries by sorting them into three categories, representing a &#x0201c;low&#x0201d; (0 &#x0003c; 1),
&#x0201c;medium&#x0201d; (1-2), and &#x0201c;high&#x0201d; degree of knowledge (&#x0003e;2) presently available with
respect to function and/or biological role (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab3">Table 3</xref>). Low knowledge results
from the fact that the number of publications is low and/or the amount of
extracted functional information is minute or currently still unavailable. For
proteins with moderate knowledge, either many publications or some evidence of
a particular biological function is publicly accessible. Solid knowledge with a
high <italic>pfs</italic> is only reflected by
well-documented, reliable information concerning biological function, in
particular, clear-cut statements without speculative statements or negative
expressions concerning function. The <italic>pfs</italic> for all Swiss-Prot entries 
can be obtained online at
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://biwww.che.sbg.ac.at/PFS/">http://biwww.che.sbg.ac.at/PFS/</ext-link>.</p><p>Due to the fact that this
novel quality score reflects commonly available knowledge concerning a
protein's function, we next appended <italic>pfs</italic> to the headers of sequence data files, which we subsequently used for sequence
comparisons. When performing protein-protein sequence comparisons with the aid
of BLASTP as a search algorithm and Swiss-Prot as a data source, now, the
result lists displayed not only a generic protein name, but also provided a
list with additional notice specifying the functional information content of
any particular hit. In this way, the most informative link becomes highlighted,
and furthermore, the quality and quantity of functional data, which are
available for a set of proteins related to the subject sequence, can be
immediately extracted. This service is also freely accessible online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://biwww.che.sbg.ac.at/PFS/">http://biwww.che.sbg.ac.at/PFS/</ext-link>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>4. Discussion</title><p>Functional annotations of
proteins are collected and provided in databases. Although bioinformatic
analyses are regarded to provide unprecedented precision and high performance
and are thus being employed to specifically define biological mechanisms at the
molecular, genomic, and cellular level, most researchers in life science still
(like to) read and survey data collections 
without applying a
standardized validation method. Since knowledge regarding the
biological function of proteins is not evenly distributed in databases, and standardized bioinformatic procedures, which would allow
individual researchers to specifically qualify information
provided in knowledge databases, have not been established yet, which allow individual researchers to specifically qualify information
provided in knowledge databases, we developed a novel method. Assessment and
cross validation of the current knowledge regarding proteins presented in Swiss-Prot
by this linguistic analysis yielded results, which can be hardly achieved by
any sort of peer evaluation procedure. In line with this, it is also not
surprising that only in selected cases a strong correlation between results of
the presented peer data and <italic>pfs</italic> characterization became apparent. Moreover, assignment of <italic>pfs</italic> can be easily adjusted to validate other scientific databases,
which, for example, accumulate large amounts of textual descriptions or papers. 
In the context of annotated protein data, <italic>pfs</italic> can now be employed to determine the knowledge status of large sets of proteins
or groups of homologous proteins as well as to tentatively assign potential functions
to any proteome.</p><p>Considering the impact on daily
research, we propose that <italic>pfs</italic> is
appended to protein identifiers within a sequence comparison result list. In
this way, nonexperts in a particular field quickly obtain a ranked listing of
knowledge distribution when examining the hit list. In addition, tagging
protein identifiers with <italic>pfs</italic> are most
helpful for identifying links, which guide one to the most informative database
entry. Hence, we regard <italic>pfs</italic> as an
important improvement for accelerating data mining strategies and to providing
new avenues for evaluating data derived from genomic and proteomic projects. In
the near future, this tool may become an invaluable tool for curators of
knowledge databases, primarily to earmark entries which are of minor quality,
in order to either eliminate the entry or to improve it during a subsequent
update.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Natalie Sampson
